Developer's Notes, please ignore

Okay so we clearly want a div on the left to contain the image and any other associated information, and the right will contain the form.

Left Image Container
Some image, probably the company name, then a photo credit at the bottom of the image

Right Form Div
Company name in title text
Disclaimer that this is not a real form
Form (no real action)
    A fieldset containing everything
        Legend
        First Name - text
        Last Name - text
        Email - email 
        Phone Number - number (with regex (?))
        Password - password
        Confirm Password - password
